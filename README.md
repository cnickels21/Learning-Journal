# Welcome to My Learning Journal!

My name is Chase Nickels, and I grew up in small town USA! More specifically, I am from northwoods Wisconsin where Lake Superior is my home. I grew up playing saxophone, and, in my years as a musician, have learned to play guitar, bass, and piano. I currently play bass for my band **Them Dirty Bones**, a four piece rock band with one album and one national tour under our belts. I also love to read and spend as much time as I can with my German Shepherd, Apollo. For any present or future projects of mine you can find my Github portfolio [here](https://github.com/cnickels21).

## The Growth Mindset

Here I will be discussing the differences between a growth mindset and a fixed mindset, as well as how you can use the growth mindset to better yourself and your life on every level. Simply stated, the growth mindset is a perception of life that you can use to become the best version of yourself!

More extensively, the difference between the growth mindset and the fixed mindset is how you respond to different aspects of your life, including;

- Challenges
- Obstacles
- Effort
- Criticism
- Success of Others
