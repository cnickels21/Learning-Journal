# Welcome to My Learning Journal!

My name is Chase Nickels, and I grew up in small town USA! More specifically, I am from northwoods Wisconsin where Lake Superior is my home. I grew up playing saxophone, and, in my years as a musician, have learned to play guitar, bass, and piano. I currently play bass for my band **Them Dirty Bones**, a four piece rock band with one album and one national tour under our belts. I also love to read and spend as much time as I can with my German Shepherd, Apollo. For any present or future projects of mine you can find my Github portfolio [here](https://github.com/cnickels21).

## The Growth Mindset

Here I will be discussing the differences between a growth mindset and a fixed mindset, as well as how you can use the growth mindset to better yourself and your life on every level. Simply stated, the growth mindset is a perception of life that you can use to become the best version of yourself!

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/cnickels21/Learning-Journal/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
