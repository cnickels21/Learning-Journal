# Welcome to My DeltaV Experience!

My name is Chase Nickels, and I grew up in small town USA! More specifically, I am from northern Wisconsin where Lake Superior is what I would call home. I grew up playing saxophone, and, in my years as a musician, have learned to play guitar, bass, and piano. I currently play bass for my band **Them Dirty Bones**, a four piece rock band with one album and one national tour under our belts \(look for a fox head with cross bones if you're interested\). I also love to read and spend as much time as I can with my German Shepherd, Apollo. For any present or future projects of mine you can find my Github portfolio [here](https://github.com/cnickels21).
