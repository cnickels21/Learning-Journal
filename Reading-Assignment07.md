## Programming with JavaScript

In order to understand how javascript works, you first need to know a few key terms and how they work together. The language itself is called script, which is essentially a list of instructions that you tell the computer to perform in order to return your desired outcome. The syntax of the language is your structural rules, or your sentencing within the language. Within the script you have expressions that combine different values to return your desired outcome.  Now that we have covered some basic terminology, understanding how your code works within the computer is important. Flow charts are a useful tool for this, as they allow you to lay out what you want your code to accomplish and then list the tasks your computer needs to perform in order to achieve your goal. The flow chart is very useful in helping visualize how you need to lay your code out before you start writing.

Now that we understand basics of how javascript operates, let's talk about how you can use functions to respond to the user. First you create your function by giving it a name. Definitive names are important as they describe what exactly the function is doing within the code. Then you set the declarations of your function. These declarations are the rules that your computer will follow when it attempts to run your function. The basic format for a function is as follows:

function functionName\(\) \{
\\declarations or code goes here
\}

Or you can create a function with parameters to return a certain statement to the user after they have submitted certain data into the site. An example of this is as follows:

function functionName\(parameters\) \{
\\declarations
\}

Then, once the user has submitted the requested data, otherwise known as arguments, the computer will output the desired outcome accordingly. However, there is one more step to functions when writing them in your code. As you can see you have created the function and declared the rules within it, but this is only the first step. Next you have to call your code simply by using your function's name somewhere outside of the curly braces used to declare your rules. The extremely useful thing about functions is that with them you are able to call the same set of instructions multiple times throughout your page without rewriting the same code in different places. All you have to do is call your functions name wherever you want it, and it will render accordingly.
