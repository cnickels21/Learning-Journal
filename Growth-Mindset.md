## The Growth Mindset

Here I will be discussing the differences between a growth mindset and a fixed mindset, as well as how you can use the growth mindset to better yourself and your life on every level. Simply stated, the growth mindset is a perception of life that you can use to become the best version of yourself!

More extensively, the difference between the growth mindset and the fixed mindset is how you respond to different aspects of your life, including;

- Challenges
- Obstacles
- Effort
- Criticism
- Success of Others

When facing challenges with the growth mindset you embrace them because you know that they help you to learn, whether that is based on your mistakes until you overcome them, or by pushing yourself to face them with your head held high, whereas with a fixed mindset, you will avoid them and not accomplish much, if anything.  The same can be said for obstacles, that in when facing them with a fixed mindset you will lose focus and more than likely become blocked from accomplishing your task. A growth mindset will help you with facing the obstacle until you overcome whatever is holding you back.  As for effort, with a growth mindset you will understand that effort is work, and that every step of your life will include some amount of work, but you will never let this hold you back from giving it your best.  However, with a fixed mindset, you will view each and every step you take as pointless.  Then there is criticism.  We have _all_ been subject to this at some point in our life, but the growth mindset allows you to learn from said criticism so as to be better than you have been next time.  Someone with a fixed mindset will ignore this criticism and never learn the lesson they are facing.  Finally there is the success of others.  If you have a growth mindset, then you will cherish the idea and event of someone elses success for a multitude of reasons; their success could help lead to your future success, or seeing them improve their life will inspire you to fight harder for a better future, not only for you, but for everyone around you.  A fixed mindset would leave you feeling threatened by their success because you see them as competition instead of someone to help you in the future.

It can be easy to find yourself in a fixed mindset though.  One day you are the optimist and the enthusiast, but then life throws you a curve ball that could easily drag you into a negative mindset; such as your car breaking down or a fight you had with a friend.  It is important to remind yourself of the power you have over your life and how you can face these hard times with your head held high.  Here is a list of three things you can do to keep yourself in a growth mindset when faced with a difficult situation:

1. Remind yourself that these hard times will pass, and, with strength of heart, you can face anything the world throws at you.
2. Remember that you are only human, and that through our mistakes we can learn the lessons of the world.
3. Find something to smile about.  No matter how small or menial, there is always beauty in this world, and sometimes that is enough.

Never forget that we are here to expand and grow, just as the universe does all around us.  It is important to keep your mind and heart clear of any negativity that will drag you down, and, when faced with any challenges or hard times, never be afraid to reach out for help.  There are more extended hands in the world than any of us quite realize, and by helping each other grow, we help ourselves grow.
