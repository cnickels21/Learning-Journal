# Reading Assignment 08
## Operators and Loops

There are a few different operators that you use to render different data types within your code, and to render those data types in different ways. The assignment operator is the most common as this is how you assign values to your variables, functions, expectations for declarations, and so on. Arithmetic operators, like in basic math, combine different values together in an expression to be assigned to your variables and such. The only string operator is the plus symbol, as it is only used to combine strings, thus creating sentences and statements in various ways. Finally there are comparison and logical operators that, in different fasions, return boolean values. The comparison operator does just that; it compares different values to be returned as true or false. Logical operators combine multiple boolean expressions to return a true or false value.

Loops use many operators in many different ways in order to repeat a declared rule until a certain expectation has been met. The basic types of loops are for loops and while loops. A for loop will repeat itself a certain number of times based on the specifications you set for it. A while loop will repeat itself continuously until your condition has been met. With loops you need three basic statements within their declaration block in order for them to process. First is the value that is coming into the loop, whether you set that within the rule set itself or if it is pulling a value from somewhere else in your code. Then is the condition that must be met before the loop no longer repeats itself. Finally, you have an expression of some sort that changes the value of the variable coming into the loop. Often times this a simple incrementation or decrementation, simply denoted by either ++ or -- respectively. Loops are extremely useful in your web page as they allow you to require specific input from your user before accomplishing a requested task.
