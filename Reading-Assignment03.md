## Revisions and the Cloud

We now know what Github is and what a versatile tool it is for creating web pages to share on the internet. However, in the coding industry, you will often want to make revisions to a file without them being automatically applied. Also, you will find that many different people will be tasked with working on the same project. For this end there are version control systems, and a variety of types of VCS's. These varietys include:

1. Local Version Control Systems
2. Centralized Version Control Systems
3. Distributed Version Control Systems

These VCS's allow you to make changes to a file without having to render and save multiple copies of the same project.  Git allows you to pull down a file from a global repository and edit it yourself where you can then push the edited version back out to Github.

Git is different than github wherein it acts as a DVCS. This gives you have a secondary save state of the files that you are working with to create your project, or a back up if you will, as well as being a version tracking system. This means that you can track all of the changes that you have made to a file and revert back to them if needed.

Once you have cloned your repo down to a directory within your system, git adds your changes to the project through the 'git-flow' which consists of a series of three simple commands used in your terminal: add, commit, and push /(ACP if you will/). When commiting these changes to the repo it is important to provide simple and definitive messages as to what changes were made while working on the file locally.
