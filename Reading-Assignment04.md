## Structure Wep Pages with HTML

HTML, or hypertext markup language, is what you use to structure your web page using a large variety of elements, all the way from your header and footer, to images, articles, navigation links and external links, and many more. The first thing you need when writing html is your doctype which tells the server what version of the language you are using. Then come your elements, which consist of an opening tag, a closing tag, any attributes used to modify the element, and the content itself. The content is what the user will see when visiting your web page, and the attributes are used to modify/customize the element itself. There are a few elements that are self closing, images for example, that only require one tag and a reference link within to create the content you desire. All of these elements are contained within the body element that comprises the entire page that the user is seeing.

You can customize your html code using css and make your webpage more interactive with javascript, but first you have to consider the users that you are catering to. You want your webpage to be both interesting and easy for them to use, otherwise they won't come back. To this end, it is good practice to start with a wireframe and persona. A wireframe is a basic template of how you want your page to be structured without being concerned with your presentational aesthetics. The persona is a profile model of your customer demographic. With these two tools, you are able to obtain an idea of accessibility and usefulness. Once you know these things you can begin laying the foundation for your project...the code itself.
