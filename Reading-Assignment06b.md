## Computer Architecture and Logic

How a computer works is strictly a logical process. The computer takes the information that you give it, stores that information within its memory, processes and manipulates the information that you give it, and then returns that information back to you. Originally, computers were designed strictly to manipulate numbers and perform calculations, which at the time was extremely innovative, but have come so far as to allow a watch to monitor our heart beat or allowing a car to give you the directions of how to get somewhere. How a computer does this is using the binary language, which is literally electrical signals flowing through the circuits of your computer. Unlike the decimal system, the binary language is comprised of only ones and zeroes that are combined to create any value you ask the computer to give you. These electrical signals are then processed by the CPU and returned to you after having performed the function that you asked it to do.

A computer is able to do this using two components. First, you have your hardware; the physical composition of your computer. The hardware includes the wires and circuits that store information and run processes for you, input devices such as your keyboard or the touch screen of your phone, and output devices that return the information to you. Then there is your software that is used to ask your computer to perform these tasks. You computers operating system is the master software that processes all of the children software of your computer, otherwise known as all of your programs. Your computer never deals directly with the programs, as the programs have to travel through your OS in order to then go through your four basic steps that the computer performs; take input, store information, process information, and output information.
