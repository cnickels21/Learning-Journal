## The Coder's Computer

It is very important for any coder to have the proper resources at their disposal.  Without the proper tools, it is very easy for the process to become very inefficient.  Firstly, you will need a text editor that you are both familiar and comfortable with.  A text editor is a software program that you can download on your computer that allows you to write and manage the text you will use for web page or software development.  There are many options available to you here; including Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, and Atom.  Any coder or developer will always have their preferred text editor, so it is up to you to decide which one might work best for you.  You can do this by trying multiple programs and see how the suit your needs.  The most important properties to consider when choosing your text editor are: 1. code completion, 2. syntax highlighting, 3. a variety of themes, and 4. a wide variety of extensions to modify the program with.  These are important because they allow for efficiency and comfortability.  It is also important to remember that, early on in your coding career, you may not know what you are looking for, but, as you progress and improve, you will learn what you prefer and want from the applications you are working with.

Secondly, you will find that it is much easier to navigate your computer using a command line, or a terminal, instead of manually running all of your processes.  Remember, computers are here to help us, so let them do the work for you whenever possible.  The terminal allows for us to navigate to and from different directories (or files), which are locations within our computer, as well as give us detailed information about those directories.  The terminal is a very useful tool that allows you an efficient way to create and modify the different coding languages you will be working with for wep page development and so on, but it can be a bit scary to use at first.  Give it time and you will learn the tricks of the industry.  For now, here are a few basic commands that you will be using when working with your terminal:

1. **pwd** (Print Work directory) shows you the directory you're currently in
2. **ls** gives you a list of all of the files/folders within your current directory
3. **ls -a** is the same as _ls_ only it includes all hidden files
4. **clear** clears the terminal screen completely 

There is also the matter of absolute and relative paths.  The key difference is, if you were to list the contents of a directory using a relative path, it would list the contents of your current directory, but a list of an absolute path can be acquired no matter what directory you are in because you are calling for that list from its root directory (for example; home/user/documents).

Now you have an idea as to what you will need in order to accomplish your tasks within your coding career.  A good text editor and an efficient program to navigate your computer with are key to helping you become the best coder you can be.  It is important to find what works best for you, but it is also important to understand and follow industry standards.  Always ask for help if you need it, and never be afraid to make mistakes, for that is how we learn.
