## Dynamic Web Pages with JavaScript

JavaScript is a scripting language that works within the browser itself in order to create interactivity between your web page and said browser. This language uses variables to define data by assigning values to said variables and then calling upon that data to create different functions within your web page. Firstly, you should understand the different data types. These are as follows:

- Numbers
- Strings \(text\)
- Boolean \(true or false\)
- Null \(not real\)
- Undefined \(no value\)
- Symbol \(value\)
- NaN \(not a number\)

These different data types can be combined in many different ways to create many different out comes; for example, you could type out 'true == false' in your code editor and come up with the value of true. This can be very confusing at first, but as you familiarize yourself more with this language you will understand how this all ties into creating the desired outcome for your web page.

Once you have an understanding of these different data types and the different ways you can work with them you can begin creating functions on your web page. Examples of how you would use this language are as follows. If you have a newsletter that users need to sign up for, you would create a function that prompts them to enter their email address and any other key information necessary. Similarly you could have a page where returning users create a profile for long term use of your web page. You can also allow your web page to pull the date from your system, or even a worldwide database because some users will be in different time zones, or even affected by daylight savings time. The expansiveness of this language is out of this world, and what you are able to do with your web page comes down to what you want your users to experience when interacting with your web page in their browser.
